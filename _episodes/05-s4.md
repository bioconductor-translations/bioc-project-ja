title: "The S4 class system in Bioconductor"
teaching: XX
exercises: XX
questions:
- "What is the S4 class system?"
- "How does Bioconductor use S4 classes?"
objectives:
- "Explain what S4 classes, generics, and methods are."
- "Identify S4 classes at the core of the Bioconductor package infrastructure."
- "Create S4 objects and apply S4 methods."
keypoints:
- "S4 classes store information in slots, and check the validity of the information every time objects are updated."
- "To ensure the continued integrity of S4 objects, users should not access slots directly, but using dedicated functions."
- "S4 generics invoke different implementations of the method depending on the class of the object that they are given."

# Install packages

Before we can proceed into the following sections, we install some Bioconductor packages that we will need.

# S4Vectors

The *[S4Vectors](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.14/S4Vectors)* package defines the `Vector` and `List` virtual classes and a set of generic functions that extend the semantic of ordinary vectors and lists in R.
Through the S4 class system, package developers can easily implement vector-like or list-like objects as concrete subclasses of `Vector` or `List`.

Virtual classes -- such as `Vector` and `List` -- cannot be instantiated into objects themselves.
Instead, those virtual classes provide core functionality inherited by all the concrete classes that are derived from them.

For instance, a few low-level concrete subclasses of general interest (e.g. `DataFrame`, `Rle`, and `Hits`) are implemented in the *[S4Vectors](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.14/S4Vectors)* package itself, while many more are implemented in other packages throughout the Bioconductor project (e.g., *[IRanges](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.14/IRanges)*).

Attach the package to the current R session as follows.

> Note 
>
> The package startup messages printed in the console are worth noting that the *[S4Vectors](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.14/S4Vectors)* package masks a number of functions from the [base][r-package-base] package when the package is attached to the session.
> This means that the *[S4Vectors](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.14/S4Vectors)* package includes an implementation of those functions, and that -- being the latest package attached to the R session -- its own implementation of those functions will be found first on the R search path and used instead of their original implementation in the [base][r-package-base] package.
> 
> In many cases, masked functions can be used as before without any issue.
> Occasionally, it may be necessary to disambiguate calls to masked function using the package name as well as the function name, e.g. `base::anyDuplicated()`.
