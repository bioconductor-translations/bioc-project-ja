This lesson was developed and tested with R version 4.1.2 (2021-11-01).

Take a moment to launch RStudio and verify that you are using R version `4.1.x`, with `x` being any patch version, e.g. `4.1.2`.

This is important because Bioconductor uses the version of R running in the current session to determine the version of Bioconductor packages that can be installed in the R library associated with the current R session.
Using a different version of R while following this lesson may lead to unexpected results.
